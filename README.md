* Windows & Web have been tested and are working fine.
* Due to macOS's unnecessary security you probably can't simply run the macOS version.
* The macOS version does work with both Intel chips and Apple Silicon.
* We were too tired to test the Linux version. You can come back later.

# Inspiration
After our first adventure in game dev, we wanted to further explore this field by making a larger, 3D game.

# Background Story
You have crashed onto earth and need to leave FAST before humans catch you. Your mission is to fight your way through the city and exit to safety so no one can find you.

# Challenges we overcame
* Getting physics to work
* Finding Assets
* Fixing Lighting and Shadows
* Making sure enemies

# What we are proud of
* Despite being our second game, we wera able to make a 3D game right away.
* Being able to make an improved combat systems with health bars and more complex enemy AI.
* Having a more coherent story

# Things we learned
* Creating Healthbars
* 3D is like 2D, but with an extra dimension
* Creating complex enemy AI, aggro ranges, sight, subroutines, formations.

# Built With
* Unity
* Unity Cloud
* C#

# Future Improvments
* Improve the lighting
* Improve enemy AI and variety
* Make some cutscenes
* Add quest markers so that players know where they are going
* More Animations


# Acknowledgments
We would like to thank Unity for providing us with student licenses and the assets for the main character and the background, Polygon Blacksmith for the enemy models, Triplebrick for the final boss, and Sabri Ayes for some environmental assets.
